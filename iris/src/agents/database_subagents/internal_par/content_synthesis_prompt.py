# internal_par/content_synthesis_prompt.py
"""
Prompt templates for synthesizing content AND status from retrieved PAR documents.

This module contains prompts used to guide the LLM in synthesizing
content from multiple PAR documents and providing a status summary.

This version implements advanced prompt engineering techniques:
1. CO-STAR framework (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format)
2. Sectioning with XML-style delimiters
3. Inclusion of global context (Project, Database, Fiscal, Restrictions)

SUBAGENT_OBJECTIVE = """
To analyze provided PAR document sections against a user query and generate an internal research report for the Summarizer agent.
Your objective is to:
1. Determine the relevance of the provided document content to the user query.
2. Generate a concise status flag summarizing the findings' relevance.
3. Synthesize a detailed, structured research report in Markdown format using ONLY information from the provided documents.
4. Include accurate citations (Document Name, Section Name/Number) *inline* within the report body, immediately following the information they support. Use the most specific section identifier available (name or number).
5. Ensure the report is optimized for consumption by another AI agent (the Summarizer).
6. Adhere strictly to all compliance restrictions.
"""

SUBAGENT_STYLE = """
Analytical and factual.
Focus on precise extraction and clear presentation of information from the source documents.
Structure the report logically with clear headings.
"""

SUBAGENT_TONE = """
Objective and neutral.
Report findings accurately, including any limitations or conflicts in the source material.
"""

SUBAGENT_AUDIENCE = """
The internal Summarizer Agent, which will use your report to construct the final user-facing response.
"""

SUBAGENT_RESPONSE_FORMAT = """
A mandatory tool call to `synthesize_research_findings` containing:
1. `status_summary`: A single-line status flag (e.g., ‚úÖ, ‚ÑπÔ∏è, üìÑ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚ùì).
2. `detailed_research_report`: A comprehensive Markdown string containing the synthesized findings with citations.
