The testing methodology for Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) is designed to:
- Evaluate control design effectiveness
- Assess operating effectiveness over time
- Identify and remediate control deficiencies
- Support management's annual assertion on ICFR

## Testing Phases

The ICFR testing program follows these phases:

1. **Planning**
   - Annual risk assessment and scoping
   - Test schedule development
   - Resource allocation
   - Methodology updates and communication

2. **Design Effectiveness Testing**
   - Review of control documentation
   - Walkthrough procedures
   - Design gap identification
   - Remediation of design issues before operating effectiveness testing

3. **Operating Effectiveness Testing**
   - Execution of test procedures
   - Evidence collection and evaluation
   - Deficiency identification and classification
   - Results communication

4. **Reporting and Remediation**
   - Aggregation of test results
   - Deficiency evaluation
   - Remediation plan development

## Sample Size Determination

Sample sizes for control testing are based on control frequency and significance:

| Control Frequency | Standard Sample Size | Key Control Sample Size |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Annual | 1 | 1 |
| Quarterly | 2 | 4 (all quarters) |
| Monthly | 3 | 6 (alternating months) |
| Weekly | 8 | 12 (distributed across year) |
| Daily | 15 | 25 (distributed across year) |

## Sample Selection Methodology

Samples must be selected using these principles:

1. **Representative Selection**
   - Cover the entire testing period
   - Include period-end instances
   - Incorporate high-risk periods (e.g., financial close)

2. **Risk-Based Considerations**
   - Include samples from high-volume periods
   - Select instances following system or process changes
   - Include instances from different operators if control is performed by multiple people

3. **Random Selection**
   - Use statistical randomization where possible
   - Document selection methodology
   - Avoid predictable patterns that might influence control performance

- Date of control execution
- Name of control performer
- Evidence examined
- Test results
- Exceptions noted
- Conclusion on effectiveness""",
